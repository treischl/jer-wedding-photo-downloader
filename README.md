# JEROME Wedding Photo Downloader

I didn't see a *Download All* button on my brother-in-law's wedding photo site. So I got the photo URLs from my browser dev tools and wrote a script.

## Getting Started

Clone the repostitory and either `npm start` or `node index.js` from the project root.

*Warning*: Downloading wedding photos of people you don't know may be considered creepy by everyone. If you don't know anyone at this wedding, maybe try not running the code?

### Prerequisites

This was written using and "tested" against Node.js v10.15.2.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this project and make any updates you'd like, but there aren't any plans to maintain it. I've got kids so my time is at a premium.

## Versioning

1.0.0 is intended to be the first and final version. If I ever do update this project, I'll probably follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/), but please don't count on or expect any updates.
